- Add XGBoost for variance prediction (simple ensemble)
- Focus on business logic over complex models

**B4.3 ML Pipeline** â†’ **Simplified Architecture**
- Replace complex ensemble with Prophet + XGBoost residual correction
- Use PostgreSQL + Redis instead of dedicated feature store
- MLflow community edition for simple versioning

**B4.4 Reconciliation Engine** â†’ **Rule-based with ML Assist**
- Primary: Rule-based matching algorithms
- Secondary: Simple ML for ambiguous cases
- Focus on accuracy through business logic

#### **2. Phase 4 B5.2 Integration Framework**
**Timeline:** Parallel with Phase 3 completion  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical for data quality)

**Focus:** Data quality improvements over complex ML
- QuickBooks, Xero, Plaid, TrueLayer integrations
- Real-time data synchronization
- Better input data â†’ better predictions regardless of model complexity

### **TIER 2: HIGH-ROI ENHANCEMENTS (Months 3-8)**

#### **3. Hybrid Categorization System**
**Timeline:** 4 weeks  
**Approach:** Pragmatic ML deployment

```python
categorization_strategy = {
    "phase_1": "Enhanced rule-based (80% coverage)",
    "phase_2": "FinBERT for ambiguous cases (20%)",
    "deployment": "Cost-optimized hybrid approach"
}
```

#### **4. Enhanced Forecasting**
**Timeline:** 3 weeks  
**Approach:** Incremental improvements

```python
forecasting_enhancement = {
    "current": "Keep existing Prophet",
    "enhancement": "Add XGBoost residual correction",
    "features": "Better business logic features",
    "target": "15-20% accuracy improvement"
}
```

#### **5. Basic Financial Intelligence**
**Timeline:** 8 weeks  
**Approach:** Simple but effective

**Tax Forecasting:**
- 90% rule-based calculations
- 10% XGBoost for edge cases
- Focus on compliance over sophistication

**Payment Prediction:**
- XGBoost + Logistic Regression ensemble
- Feature engineering based on business patterns
- Simple but interpretable models

---

### **TIER 3: COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATOR (Months 7-15)**

#### **6. Dr. Sigmund Spend Implementation**
**Timeline:** 20 weeks (as planned)  
**Priority:** P0 (Core differentiator)

**No changes** - this remains the primary competitive advantage and justifies complex LLM implementation.
