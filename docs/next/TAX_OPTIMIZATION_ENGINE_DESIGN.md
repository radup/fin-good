```

#### **Dr. Sigmund's Guidance:**
```
"Ach, income timing is like conducting a financial orchestra, mein friend! Ze key is not to rush or delay everything, but to find ze right rhythm for your situation. Let me show you three approaches:

üí° Strategy 1: Accelerate Income (Send invoices now)
   ‚Ä¢ Tax savings this year: $2,400
   ‚Ä¢ Cash flow: +$15,000 in December
   ‚Ä¢ Dr. Sigmund says: 'Good if you expect higher tax rates next year'

üí° Strategy 2: Defer Income (Wait until January)  
   ‚Ä¢ Tax deferral: $3,200 saved until next April
   ‚Ä¢ Cash flow: Delayed but potentially better tax position
   ‚Ä¢ Dr. Sigmund says: 'Perfect if you expect lower income next year'

üí° Strategy 3: Installment Planning
   ‚Ä¢ Spreads tax burden evenly over 2 years
   ‚Ä¢ Predictable cash flow and tax planning
   ‚Ä¢ Dr. Sigmund says: 'Ze most zen approach - steady and stress-free!'

Remember, mein friend, ze best tax strategy is one zat helps you sleep peacefully at night, ja?"
