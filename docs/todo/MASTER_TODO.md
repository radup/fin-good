## 🚨 Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Security Foundation** (CRIT-001 to CRIT-008) must be completed before production deployment
2. **Testing Framework** (CRIT-009) is required before implementing other tests
3. **Error Handling Standardization** (CRIT-010, CRIT-015) should be done before new feature development
4. **Database Migrations** (HIGH-009) required before schema changes
