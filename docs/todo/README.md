# FinGood Todo Management System

## Overview
This directory contains all project todos organized by priority and domain. Each todo item is tracked with assigned agents, implementation status, and code review requirements.

## File Structure
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MASTER_TODO.md           # Complete list of all todos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ critical/                # Critical priority todos (fix immediately)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ high/                    # High priority todos (1-2 weeks)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ medium/                  # Medium priority todos (2-4 weeks)

## Priority Levels

### üî¥ CRITICAL (24-48 hours)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity issues
- Production blockers
- Testing framework setup

### üü† HIGH (1-2 weeks)
- Performance issues
- Core functionality gaps
- API standardization
- Test implementation

### üü° MEDIUM (2-4 weeks)
- Code quality improvements
- Refactoring tasks
- Infrastructure setup
- Feature enhancements

### üü¢ LOW (Ongoing)
- Documentation
- Developer experience
- Advanced features
- Nice-to-have improvements

## Agent Assignment

Each todo is assigned to the most appropriate specialized agent:

| Agent | Specialization | Example Tasks |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| fintech-compliance-engineer | Security, compliance, regulations | JWT security, secrets management, PCI compliance |
| qa-test-expert | Testing, quality assurance | Test frameworks, coverage, automation |
| python-backend-architect | Backend architecture, APIs | FastAPI optimization, database design |
| frontend-react-engineer | Frontend, React, UI/UX | Component architecture, performance |
| data-pipeline-architect | Database, data processing | Migrations, indexing, query optimization |
| senior-code-reviewer | Code quality, best practices | Refactoring, code standards, reviews |
| architecture-reviewer | System design, infrastructure | CI/CD, deployment, monitoring |
| api-designer | API specification, documentation | OpenAPI, REST design, versioning |

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Todo Selection
```bash
# View current critical todos
cat docs/todo/MASTER_TODO.md | grep "üî¥ TODO"

# Select next item based on priority and dependencies
```

### 2. Agent Assignment
```bash
# Example: Assign CRIT-001 to fintech-compliance-engineer
# This happens automatically based on the todo categorization
```

### 3. Implementation Process
1. **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b fix/CRIT-001-secret-key-security`
2. **Implement Solution**: Agent implements with proper error handling
3. **Add Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage required
4. **Code Review**: Senior review required for all changes
5. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant docs
6. **Mark Complete**: Update todo status

### 4. Code Review Requirements

Every todo implementation must include:

#### ‚úÖ Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Proper input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS and CSRF protection

#### ‚úÖ Error Handling
- [ ] Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- [ ] Proper error logging
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Transaction rollback where needed

#### ‚úÖ Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Error scenario testing
- [ ] Security testing for sensitive code
- [ ] Performance testing for database changes

#### ‚úÖ Code Quality
- [ ] Follows project coding standards
- [ ] Proper TypeScript/Python typing
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Clear variable/function naming
- [ ] Adequate comments for complex logic

#### ‚úÖ Documentation
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] Architecture docs updated
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic

## Status Tracking

### Status Indicators
- üî¥ TODO: Not started
- üü° IN PROGRESS: Currently being worked on  
- üü¢ COMPLETED: Finished and code reviewed
- ‚ùå BLOCKED: Waiting on dependencies
- üîÑ REVIEW: Pending code review

### Progress Updates
Update `MASTER_TODO.md` after each completed item:

```bash
# Update status in MASTER_TODO.md
sed -i 's/üî¥ TODO/üü¢ COMPLETED/' docs/todo/MASTER_TODO.md

# Move completed item to completed directory
mv docs/todo/critical/CRIT-001.md docs/todo/completed/
```

## Critical Path

Some todos have dependencies that must be completed first:

1. **Security Foundation** (CRIT-001 to CRIT-008) - Required before production
2. **Testing Framework** (CRIT-009) - Required before implementing tests
3. **Error Handling** (CRIT-010, CRIT-015) - Required before new features
4. **Database Setup** (HIGH-009) - Required before schema changes

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start with Critical Items
```bash
# Begin with the first critical security item
echo "Starting with CRIT-001: SECRET_KEY security fix"
```

### Step 2: Use Appropriate Agent
Each todo specifies which agent should handle it. Use the Task tool to invoke the correct agent.

### Step 3: Follow Implementation Workflow
1. Implement solution with comprehensive error handling
2. Add extensive tests (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Perform thorough code review
4. Update documentation
5. Mark as completed

### Step 4: Track Progress
Update the master todo list and move completed items to the completed directory.

## Quality Gates

Before marking any todo as complete:

1. ‚úÖ **All tests pass** (unit, integration, E2E)
2. ‚úÖ **Code review approved** by senior reviewer
3. ‚úÖ **Security review passed** (for security-related changes)
4. ‚úÖ **Performance verified** (for database/API changes)
5. ‚úÖ **Documentation updated**
6. ‚úÖ **Error handling tested** in all scenarios
