## üöÄ Migration Execution Procedures

### Step 1: Pre-Execution Validation

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/fingood/backend

# Run comprehensive safety checks
python migrations/safety/safety_cli.py check MIGRATION_ID --level critical

# Validate data integrity
python migrations/test_migrations.py --validate-data

# Test rollback procedures
python migrations/safety/safety_cli.py test-rollback MIGRATION_ID
```

### Step 2: Environment Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables
export ENVIRONMENT=production
export BACKUP_VERIFIED=true

# Verify database connectivity
python -c "from app.core.database import get_db_health; print(get_db_health())"

# Create migration session backup point
python migrations/create_backup.py --type session --migration-id MIGRATION_ID
```

### Step 3: Migration Execution

```bash
# Start audit logging
export MIGRATION_AUDIT_ENABLED=true

# Execute migration with comprehensive logging
alembic upgrade head

# Verify migration success
alembic current
alembic history --verbose
```

### Step 4: Immediate Validation

```bash
# Run post-migration data validation
python migrations/test_migrations.py --validate-data

# Check application health
python -c "from app.core.database import get_db_health; print(get_db_health())"

# Verify critical business functions
python migrations/validate_critical_functions.py
```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)

If issues are detected within 5 minutes of migration:

```bash
# Immediate rollback
alembic downgrade -1

# Verify rollback success
alembic current

# Validate data integrity
python migrations/test_migrations.py --validate-data

# Check application functionality
python migrations/validate_critical_functions.py
```

### Standard Rollback (> 5 minutes)

For rollbacks after the immediate window:

```bash
# Stop application traffic (coordinate with operations)
# Restore from session backup if data integrity is compromised
python migrations/restore_backup.py --session-id SESSION_ID

# Or perform controlled rollback
alembic downgrade -1

# Full data validation
python migrations/test_migrations.py --validate-data

# Application smoke tests
python migrations/smoke_tests.py
```

### Emergency Rollback

In case of critical system failure:

```bash
# Immediate traffic stop
# Contact emergency response team
# Restore from latest verified backup
python migrations/emergency_restore.py --latest-verified

# Incident documentation
python migrations/create_incident_report.py --type emergency
```

## üö® Emergency Response

### Critical Failure Response

1. **Immediate Actions** (0-5 minutes):
   - Stop all database writes
   - Activate incident response team
   - Preserve system state for investigation

2. **Assessment** (5-15 minutes):
   - Determine scope of impact
   - Assess data integrity
   - Evaluate rollback options

3. **Recovery** (15+ minutes):
   - Execute appropriate recovery procedure
   - Validate system integrity
   - Restore service gradually

## ‚úÖ Post-Migration Validation

### Immediate Validation (0-30 minutes)

```bash
# Database health check
python migrations/health_check.py --comprehensive

# Data integrity validation
python migrations/test_migrations.py --validate-data

# Performance baseline check
python migrations/performance_check.py --baseline

# Critical function validation
python migrations/validate_critical_functions.py
```

### Extended Validation (30 minutes - 4 hours)

```bash
# Full system smoke tests
python migrations/smoke_tests.py --full

# Performance monitoring
python migrations/monitor_performance.py --duration 4h

# User acceptance testing
python migrations/run_uat.py --financial-flows

# Compliance validation
python migrations/validate_compliance.py --all-standards
```

### Long-term Monitoring (4+ hours)

- Monitor key performance indicators
- Track error rates and response times
- Validate financial transaction processing
- Monitor audit trail completeness

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Migration Timeout

**Immediate Action**:
```bash
# Check for blocking queries
python migrations/check_blocking_queries.py

# Kill long-running queries if safe
python migrations/kill_blocking_queries.py --confirm

# Retry migration with timeout increase

alembic upgrade head
```

#### Data Integrity Violation

**Symptoms**: Data validation fails
**Immediate Action**:
```bash
# Stop migration immediately
# Preserve current state
python migrations/preserve_state.py

# Analyze integrity violations
python migrations/analyze_violations.py

# Determine rollback necessity
python migrations/assess_rollback_need.py
```

#### Performance Degradation

**Symptoms**: Slow queries, high load

```bash
# Check query performance
python migrations/analyze_performance.py

# Identify problematic queries
python migrations/find_slow_queries.py

# Consider index optimization
python migrations/suggest_indexes.py
```

#### Rollback Failure

**Symptoms**: Rollback operation fails
**Immediate Action**:
```bash
# Escalate to emergency procedure
# Contact database team immediately
# Document failure details
python migrations/document_rollback_failure.py

# Prepare for manual recovery
python migrations/prepare_manual_recovery.py
